  - Since this is our textbook, I've been relying on it heavily to understand the fundametical mathematical structure behind model selection. After I am confident in my understanding given the Wasserman text, I go to Cassella and Berger to introduce more mathematical rigor to my understanding of the concept. 
3.  Wasserman, L. (2010). All of Statistics. Springer Nature Switzerland., Chapter 10
  - Essentially the same as above, however, Wasserman's concise view of concepts allows for an easier introduction to concepts that I can use as a baseline to ensure understanding.
