1. Cassella, G. and Berger, R. (2002). Statistical Inference. (2nd edition) Wadsworth, Inc., Belmont, CA. Chapter 8
  - Since this is our textbook, I've been relying on it heavily to understand the fundametical mathematical structure behind model selection. After I am confident in my understanding given the Wasserman text, I go to Cassella and Berger to introduce more mathematical rigor to my understanding of the concept. 
3.  Wasserman, L. (2010). All of Statistics. Springer Nature Switzerland., Chapter 10
  - Essentially the same as above, however, Wasserman's concise view of concepts allows for an easier introduction to concepts that I can use as a baseline to ensure understanding. 
5.  Sharma, Pratyush, Marko Sarstedt, Galit Shmueli, Kevin H. Kim, and Kai Oliver Thiele. "PLS-based model selection: The role of alternative explanations in information systems research." Journal of the Association for Information Systems20, no. 4 (2019): 4.
  - Provided reading material for the project.
7.   Jung, Yoonsuh. "Multiple predicting K-fold cross-validation for model selection." Journal of Nonparametric Statistics 30, no. 1 (2018): 197-215.
  - Provided reading material for the project. 
8. Sharma, Pratyush, and Kevin H. Kim, "Model Selection in Information Systems Research Using Partial Least Squares Based Structural Equation Modeling." Thirty Third International Conference on Information Systems, Orlando 2012
  - This is a paper from a number of years prior to the above paper. For me, it has provided context into their investigation that has helped me understand the evolution of their research. 
10. [Partial Least Squares (PLS) Regression by Herv´e Abdi](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://personal.utdallas.edu/~herve/Abdi-PLS-pretty.pdf)
  - This was a very concise and helpful paper that provided a great entry into PLS. 
12. [Demystifying hypothesis testing with simple Python examples by Tirthajyoti Sarkar](https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-hypothesis-testing-with-simple-python-examples-4997ad3c5294)
  - Since I haven't done much work with statistics in python outside this class, I felt that this article was helpful in showing how to get started with some basic hypothesis testing python. I also feel the author does a good job introducing the topic of hypothesis testing. 
14. [17 Statistical Hypothesis Tests in Python (Cheat Sheet)](https://machinelearningmastery.com/statistical-hypothesis-tests-in-python-cheat-sheet/)
  - My current thought process is to run a number of model selection algorithms/ hypothesis tests discussed across both articles and the textbooks, this could help provide fundamental code I will work from. 
16. [A short introduction to model selection by David Schönleber](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-short-introduction-to-model-selection-bb1bb9c73376)
  - Another helpful concise paper that discusses model selection
18. [The Complete Guide to R-squared, Adjusted R-squared and Pseudo-R-squared by Sachin Date](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-complete-guide-to-r-squared-adjusted-r-squared-and-pseudo-r-squared-4136650fc06c)
  - Another helpful article that reviews the above topic and introductory code samples. 
20. [k fold cross validation in python](https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/k-fold-cross-validation)
  - A good introduction to K fold cross validation implimentation in python, which I will have to use because it is a main focus of one of the papers.
